# Analysis-of-Linear-Non-Linear-Relationships-between-sEMG-Finger-Kinematics
This project seeks to explore correlations between sEMG and Finger Kinematics, aiming to derive a robust model with high R2 score and minimal RMSE. Its significance lies in informing the development of prosthetic hand prototypes for amputees by understanding muscle activations' impact on finger movements.
